== Why build rather than buy, anyway?

* The "sweet spot" for an Apache Isis application is one with a rich domain, such as case{nbsp}management, or order{nbsp}fulfillment

* Stepping back, does it even make sense to build such an app?  Why not just buy some off-the-shelf packaged software?

=== Why build rather than buy, anyway?


* We should distinguish between the business' core domain and any supporting sub-domains

* You should **build for your business' core domain**
** otherwise you'll be held hostage to your software vendor's view of how your company should operate
** and, you won't be able to evolve your business

* But, you should **buy for any supporting sub-domains**
** accounting, HR, document management

no business benefit in being able to pay your employees more efficiently than your competitor

=== Transformation costs

* Using packaged software means your business users will end up *translating their own internalized domain model* to/from that of the app

* *Excel* for the back-office staff to transform inputs into the form expected of the app

* **Data warehouse**s to allow executives to make sense of the state of their business
