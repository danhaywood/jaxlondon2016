== How to preserve the architectural integrity of the system?


* how do you ensure that domain logic does not leach from one layer into an adjacent layer?

* how do you ensure that its domain logic is easy to find, modify, test?

* we adopt a hexagonal architecture

* we make the *boundary of the hexagon can't be breached*

** beyond the boundary is framework code; you couldn't write business logic there even if you wanted to
** presentation and persistence concerns are orthogonal to the domain

* domain logic is easy to trace
** the *UI is a direct representation* of that domain logic

long-term, this seems to work...

* 12 years on government system
* over its lifetime, hundreds of developers
* still releasing monthly

* no adjacent layers for business logic to leach out into


Demo:

* show how a new business action is automatically shown in the UI
