== How do we preserve the architectural integrity of the application?


* how do we ensure that domain logic does not leach from one layer into an adjacent layer?

* how do we ensure that its domain logic is easy to find, modify, test?

* we adopt a hexagonal architecture

=== How do we preserve the architectural integrity of the application?

* we adopt a hexagonal architecture

** (also known as ports-and-adapters)

* we make the boundary of that hexagon solid

** because the container *is* framework code
** you couldn't write business logic there even if you wanted to
** it's an orthogonal concern

more of Dan's answer

long-term, this seems to work...

* 12 years on government system
* over its lifetime, hundreds of developers
* still releasing monthly

* no adjacent layers for business logic to leach out into

Eoin to prompt demo: "can you demo something to illustrate that?"
