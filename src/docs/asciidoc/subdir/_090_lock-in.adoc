[data-transition="fade"]
=== Coding style

* there's an ORM rehydrating the objects, so that constrains what is valid to some extent

* the Isis metamodel is quite extensible; can add support for own annotations etc

* a blend of orientations
** OO for the mutable entities
** Functional for value types (can plug in your own)
** Aspect oriented for the cross-cutting concerns





[data-transition="fade"]
=== Deployment Options

* prototyping

* production

** on the Apache Isis platform
** host within Spring/CDI say
