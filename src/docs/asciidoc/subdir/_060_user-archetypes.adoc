=== Problem solvers

* Problem solvers are *domain experts*, who use the application every day

* Generally *interact with entities* directly
** View models reserved for high-volume use cases

* The app provides a *toolbox* for problem solvers, but doesn't mandate a process
** the process is maleable and in the user's own head

* Just use Apache{nbsp}Isis' default "Wicket" viewer

=== Process followers

* Process followers are *non-expert*, just want to accomplish simple goal

* Typically *interact with view models*
** simplifications of the domain that encode a process

* Typically use a *custom app* that hits the REST API
** or, can customize the Wicket viewer to their use cases
