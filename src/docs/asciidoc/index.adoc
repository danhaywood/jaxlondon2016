Original abstract:

* A problem all software projects encounter is making sure that code reflects the desired architectural principles/constraints. Many approaches have been tested, but the practical unification of architecture and code still eludes us.

* Apache Isis takes a different approach, forcibly separating architectural constructs from domain model, combining the two at runtime. It promises to free the developer from writing “boilerplate” and focus on the domain model instead.

* In this talk we’re going to explore these architectural issues and demonstrate how the framework addresses these.

== About Us

* *Eoin Woods* is CTO at Endava, a European IT services company.  He is also the author of “Software Systems Architecture”

* *Dan Haywood* is an independent consultant & developer specializing in domain driven design.  He is an Apache member and PMC chair for apache.isis

* We met and worked together in the 90s at Sybase, and have (as friends) tracked each other's respective careers ever since

== Apache Isis (and naked objects)

* The Apache Isis framework is an implementation of the naked objects pattern
* Named & developed by Richard&nbsp;Pawson and Rob&nbsp;Matthews
** further details in Richard's "Naked&nbsp;Objects" PhD thesis
** external examiner was Trygve Reenskaug

[NOTE.speaker]
====
eoin might remark: "Why's this useful?  Because we can get a meaningful user-interface "for free".  Valuable because UX/UI is expensive to develop, is difficult to get right, difficult to keep consistent, is a fashion item so the most important bit to ensure that there are no dependencies upon...

Can we see an example of such a UI?

eoin: trade-offs, getting the UI/UX right is difficult...

(I don't know if this next bit warrants being in, but it was good fine rediscovering all these old screenshots)

== Architectural Constraints

* on the one hand constraints, well, constrain you
* on the other hand, they are key to preserving the architectural integrity


[NOTE.speaker]
====
??? perhaps a slide here talking about trade-offs/constraints?

this could leads to the response that really there's not just the technical constraints, but (almost) the belief system of the framework/pattern approach; to whit...
====




[.dan]
=== Belief/prejudices

* too much emphasis on technical concerns
** exhibit A: microservices
* conversely, not enough on the domain
* feedback loop is the most important thing
** a generic UI keeps the discussion centred on the domain, not the UI

=== Modularity support

* Mixins
** move functionality out of domain objects
** composite UI creates a coherent whole for the end-user

* Domain events
** coordinate/veto interactions between decoupled parts of the system

== Enterprise Architecture

[NOTE.speaker]
====
eoin: let's step further out to the enterprise architecture
====


* assuming you have an EA function...
* ... and the EA has agreed what the responsibilities of each bounded context
* ...




[.dan]
=== Cross-cutting concerns

* For example, each command reified to XML
** for auditing (cause/effect)
* Publish onto an event bus, eg Camel
* Once you have a metamodel in your hand...
** Another example: security
