Original abstract:

* A problem all software projects encounter is making sure that code reflects the desired architectural principles/constraints. Many approaches have been tested, but the practical unification of architecture and code still eludes us.

* Apache Isis takes a different approach, forcibly separating architectural constructs from domain model, combining the two at runtime. It promises to free the developer from writing “boilerplate” and focus on the domain model instead.

* In this talk we’re going to explore these architectural issues and demonstrate how the framework addresses these.

== About Us

* *Eoin Woods* is CTO at Endava, a European IT services company.  He is also the author of “Software Systems Architecture”

* *Dan Haywood* is an independent consultant & developer specializing in domain driven design.  He is an Apache member and PMC chair for apache.isis

* We met and worked together in the 90s at Sybase, and have (as friends) tracked each other's respective careers ever since.

== Setting the scene

The difficulty of applications over the long-term is:

[%step]

* defining and enforcing an architectural style
* ensuring a long-term coherency
* ...




[.eoin]
== Specific challenges

[%step]

* Business logic leaching into adjacent layers
* New developers, not knowing the idioms
* ...




[.dan]
== Apache Isis (and naked objects)

* The Apache Isis framework is an implementation of the naked objects pattern
* Named & developed by Richard&nbsp;Pawson and Rob&nbsp;Matthews
** further details in Richard's "Naked&nbsp;Objects" PhD thesis
** external examiner was Trygve Reenskaug

== Generic UI/UX


[%step]

* ...
* ...

[NOTE.speaker]
====
some discussion on why a generic UI might be useful/beneficial.

Things eoin mentioned last Friday included: "Why's this useful?  Because we can get a meaningful user-interface "for free".  Valuable because UX/UI is expensive to develop, is difficult to get right, difficult to keep consistent, is a fashion item so the most important bit to ensure that there are no dependencies upon...

also worth mentioning: provides is consistency throughout, with new features automatically available everywhere (eg hint support, icons via regex, calendars/maps)

eoin: can we see an example of such a generic UI?
====



[.dan]
=== Generic UIs are "good enough" for many applications

* ... though it has, admittedly, been a journey to get them to that level!

== Customizing the UI


[%step]

* ...


[NOTE.speaker]
====
eoin: trade-offs, to what extent can this UI be customized?

Suggest hold back the question on alternative UIs to next section
====


[.dan]
=== Customizing the UI


* Use annotations, provide UI hints
** eg `@Action` vs `@ActionLayout`
* Optional `.layout.xml`
** basically a DSL, modelled on Bootstrap
* CSS
** classes and Ids generated from the metamodel
* Plugins to render maps, calendars etc.

=== ... demo ...

=== Testing "UI"

[source,java]
----
@Test
public void cannotCompleteIfAlreadyCompleted()
                                        throws Exception {
    // given
    toDoItem.setComplete(true);
    // expect
    expectedExceptions.expectMessage("Already completed");
    // when
    wrap(toDoItem).completed();
}

== Architectural Constraints

[%step]

* on the one hand constraints, well, constrain you
* on the other hand, they are key to preserving the architectural integrity
* ...

[%notitle]
=== firewalls

image::architecture-constraints/180.png[width=960px]





[.dan]
=== Metamodel validators

* Used by framework itself
** eg to enforce naming conventions
* Extensible for other application-specific use cases
* Metamodel itself is extensible
** Extension object pattern




[.eoin]
== Coupling to the framework?

[%step]

* ...
* ...
* ...


[NOTE.speaker]
====
.... the idea of this section (if there's time) is to address the point that when you use a framework there's always some sort of "coupling"; either technical, or (more interestingly) in terms of having the same set of values/beliefs as the framework's authors

... latter provides an opportunity to do a demo on feedback loops/explorations
====




[.dan]
=== Decoupling from the framework

[%step]

* Apache Isis is a framework, not a library
** Domain objects have a compiled-time coupling to the "applib" (annotations), but that's about all
* Could deploy an Apache Isis app on Spring, for example
** ... or any other framework providing runtime support for dependency injection and an ORM




[.dan]
=== Belief/prejudices

* Too much emphasis on technical concerns
** exhibit A: microservices
* Conversely, not enough on the domain
* Feedback loop is the most important thing
** a generic UI keeps the discussion centred on the domain, not the UI

=== An example exploration
