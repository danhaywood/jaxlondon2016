[data-transition="fade"]
=== How does the framework help build the right system?

* By providing a *tight feedback loop*
** no UI to develop

* By demonstrating an *actual running system*
** Creates empathy/association

* Also, it builds the *ubiquitous language*

for Dan to answer

anecdote about our users, for whom we had to demonstrate the app with their actual (migrated) production data

=== Contentious? or sensible?

* Agile methods prefer developing from the outside-in
** user journeys, captured via BDD etc.

* We tend to develop from the *inside-out*
** domain entities first with their domain invariants
** then add view models to support specific use cases
** then add layouts for user experience

* We don't try to infer the domain from a bunch of screens

[data-transition="fade"]
=== Testability


* Unit testing is trivial; Apache Isis apps are glued together using *dependency injection*

* Integration testing is also done within JUnit

* We use *fixture{nbsp}scripts* (our own mini-framework) to initialize the (in-memory) database
** can also be used when prototyping

* For the tests themselves, the `WrapperFactory` service simulates the UI
** No selenium here, thank you very much!

=== Patterns and Idioms

* The framework is also somewhat opinionated

* Easy enough to learn

* Accommodates different skill levels of (developers)


NOTE: TODO - not sure this point is strong enough to keep; lots of frameworks can say this, and there's not much to demonstrate
