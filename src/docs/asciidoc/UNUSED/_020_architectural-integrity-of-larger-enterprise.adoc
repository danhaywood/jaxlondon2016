[data-transition="fade"]
=== How to ensure the application plays well in the larger enterprise?

* Every action invocation is captured as an `Interaction`
** target object, the member identifier, the arguments

* this `Interaction` object is a JAXB-annotated DTO, reified into XML

** can then be published onto an event bus

* typically consumers will call back to the REST API
** REST API with conneg support to access data
