=== How does the framework support microservices?

* the framework *automatically provides a REST API*, built out of its metamodel

* to simplify development we *integrate with Swagger*
** swagger-ui
** a maven plugin can generates the swagger spec for you

* the automatic UI also gives your back-end staff the ability to administer the service
